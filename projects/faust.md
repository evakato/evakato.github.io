`faust` is a minimal Vulkan path tracer fitted with a special filtering pipeline to improve real-time rendering quality. The implementation is based on the 2017 seminal paper "Spatiotemporal Variance-Guided Filtering: Real-Time Reconstruction for Path-Traced Global Illumination"  by Schied et al.

The naked path tracer was based on an implementation by [yknishidate](https://github.com/yknishidate/single-file-vulkan-pathtracing).
